# odin-recipes 

A webpage of different recipes as practice of basic knowlege of HTML with a focus on syntax, links and attributes. 

The recipes featured are ones I have gathered over time and tweaked to meet my preferences.

Later, as my skills improve, I hope to come back and upgrade this webpage as a way to track and share my own recipes.
